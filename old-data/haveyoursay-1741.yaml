    text: "I'd probably go for the PS3, but that's only because I've got the PS1 and PS2
      already, and it wouldn't make much sense to change consols. Always wise to wait
      until the hype's over and the price drops though (which it will).<br />The Xbox
      360 graphics are very impressive. It'll just be a matter of waiting to see if
      the PS3 can surpass the 360. The added bonus is that the design of the PS3 is so
      much more attractive than the PS2.<br />I look forward to the arrival of total
      virtual reality consols though."

      innovations that catch on with the next gen under another logo. But it has to be

      forward to the new marios, metroids and zeldas. I am also excited to try out

      they'll release other versions for the other consoles, Nintendo has obviously
      gone insane, with their gimmik based console. The 360 has most games that are

      feel that the PC is the way forward, as it has had multiplayer gaming years
      before Sega.net and Xbox Live showed up. But if I had to choose between the
      three consoles, I would purchase the Nintendo Wii. The PS3 and Xbox 360 look
      like they will be too expensive and I certainly won't pay prices of €70  for
      games that are nothing compared to games of the good old days, games which will
      be available for the Wii."

      Every time you get a new PC game it takes ages to download software patches ansd
