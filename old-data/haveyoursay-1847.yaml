      should be sold off according to the European Media Forum (EMF). <br /><br />The
      think tank claims that the music-led stations have a limited public service role
      and the BBC could raise more than £500m through a sell off. <br /><br /><b>

      primary reason for this is? Could it possibly be that these radio stations are

      did this morning on the Today programme, it's usually ex-Sun editor, Kelvin
      Mackenzie, who is shouting loudest about it. Is there any connection between his
      continuing opposition to a publicly funded BBC and his involvement with various
      privately owned media groups that might benefit finacially from any
      privitisation of BBC services? Surely not."

      service with wide and varied programming that would never be matched by a
      privatised station. Besides, how many adverts for insurance companies, car

      advertising is obviousley the lifeblood of commercial radio and by definition
      the reason why the majority of people choose the BBC, no adverts and better
      programmes. Keep all the BBC public."

      listen to them simply because they have no adverts which they would have if they

      John Peel for years if they had not been part of the BBC. Similarly Radio has
      \"The Organist Entertains\" and a myriad of specialist music programmes which
      would likely to be axed if there were part of a commercial organisation."

      play just the same top40 tunes in a different order every day? The mix of old
      and new music is perfect,the DJs are actually good at presenting and not just
      screaming \"that was...this is\" every 3/4 minutes. Radio2 is also great.The
      shows are genuinely interesting. Specialist shows on both Radio1 and 2 are
      excellent.I reckon if the stations were to be sold off, then it'll all slowly
      turn into [insert-hyped-local-station-name] FM;flooded with adverts, sponsors

As I understand it the licence is to allow one to recieve television broadcasts whether you watch the BBC channels or not so even if all the BBC was privatised you may still end up paying a licence.

    text: "I'm no fan of Radio 1 but I think Radio 2 is excellent. It has the right balance
      between 'decent' chart music, old pop and rock favourites and specialist music
      such as classical (Richard baker on Sundays) and the Big Band sound and many
      other varieties. It also broadcasts some excellent documentaries, ranging from
      rock biographies to the enchanting Radio Ballads, a series about Britain's
      industrial and cultural pastimes. Radio 2 is friendly and informative. Give it
      over to commercial enterprise and all that would be lost. Rather than complain
      about unfair competition, the EMF should encourage the commercial stations to
      make better radio shows instead of the usual dumbed down rubbish."

    text: I do not favour any privatisation of the BBC. There is however a serious problem with management as highlighted by the ridiculous salaries paid to some presenters. Such profligacy with public money by the Corporation is surely distorting costs in the whole of the entertainment business. This situation should be redressed by at best a reduction in the licence fee or at worst a freeze. There should not be an increase for some time.
