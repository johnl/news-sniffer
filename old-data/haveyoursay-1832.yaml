      /><br />The company is to receive the package – a loan of £900m and £850m
      from existing reserves – to help plug its pension fund and pay for
      modernisation.<br /><br />Chairman Allan Leighton insisted the government was
      not bailing out the Royal Mail, but investing in the company as the
      shareholder.<br /><br />Over the past year the Royal Mail said its profits rose
      17% to £355m.<br /><br /><b>Is it right for the government to offer financial
      help to public companies? What about the private sector? Does the government

The Royal Mail just keep on cutting the service. Box emptying times are a thing of the past. Next step is to tell us to post and collect our mail from a central point. Think how much that would save!

      needs to institute simpler, more user-friendly systems. A first class stamp is
      32p. If I think my letter might be a little heavier than 60g I have to take it
      to the post office, because the letter should cost me 49p. Why not 64p? In fact,
      none of the increments are divisible by 32p, which means that we're continually
      wasting the time of post office clerks. Anyway, why not make a flat fee of 50p
      for letters under 100g?"

      changes in the economic climate and get the fund re-valued to see whether a

      sooo much stealing whilst working in the sorting department ,too many managers
      looking over employees during the shift talking to their mobile(is this
      economical???) and very poor pay...so should they get any money ? NO !!! there
      is need for restructuralisation in organoisation or in other words let them sort
      out the mess themselves ! There is so much room for improvement ."

      tend to replace phone calls and the internet has brought a boom in online
      shopping. Despite reports we have a good track record and a great deal of public
      support. Liberalisation of the market won't benefit anyone other than business
      users. If management get their way you can kiss goodbye to the universal service
      and the single stamp price. A few people at the top stand to make a fortune from

      access to its OWN profits, having for years been prevented from doing so.  There
